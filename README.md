# city-guide-final-project

Travelling to new cities is always a fun experience but sometimes you just need a little help to plan a day itinerary to make the most out of your visit. This mobile web app should make it simpler than having to flick through an overwhelmingly sized travel book when you only have a short amount of time in the city. It should allow the user to quickly swipe through attractions to create a whole day plan with information given to them about location, type, description and price (if applicable). As well as letting the user see the time to travel between them depending on their chosen selection.
