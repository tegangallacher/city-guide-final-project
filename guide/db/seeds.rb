For visitors to the capital, the main attractions of the 251 metre-high Arthur’s Seat are the unique panoramic views of Edinburgh and the surrounding area. Though the fact that it takes less than 20 minutes to climb to the summit is a bonus, which makes it the perfect day-time excursion from the city centre.",
